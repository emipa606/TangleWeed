--- Original Description ---
This mod adds a new plant called "Tangleweed vine" which is very difficult to walk through. It takes longer to grow than food crops, but not quite as long as trees.

The idea is to use it defensively, to either:

+ Plant it next to your buildings to deter enemies from getting too close.

+ Plant it so that it creates a maze for your enemies to approach your colony through.

Feedback is welcome!!
